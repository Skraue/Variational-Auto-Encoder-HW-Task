# Variational-Auto-Encoder-HW-Task
This was an individual hw project to develop a variational auto encoder that reconstructed hand written digits. In this self contained hw, the full description of the task and relevant theoretical knowledge is demsontrated, to convey a comprehensive understanding of the project.
The tasks are differentiated from the theory by the [TO COMPLETE] notation, and justifications of model choice and evaluation are written where appropriate.
